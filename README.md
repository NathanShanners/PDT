# Python Development Template (PDT)
This Python development template provides an example of how the full build environment configuration can easily be included in the design repository and mirrored across multiple developers.  This covers consistent development environment setup including virtual environments, Continuous Integration (CI) options and project management methods.

## Virtual Environment
Two options are considered for the setup of a virtual environment (venv)
1. Pip (simple)
  - Uses a requirements file (Requirements.txt)
  - https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/index.html
2. Pipenv (complex)
  - Uses a package list file and a security hashing file (Pipfile and Pipfile.lock)
  - https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Development Environment
Provides an overview for operation on different Operating Systems including setup of environment variables.  This also covers Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools (i.e. PyCharm) and how to setup specific features.  This is now covered in the wiki which is available [here](https://github.com/NathanShanners/PDT/wiki/Development-Environments)

## Continuous Integration
This section covers options for integrating CI capability into Github.

## Project Management
This covers project management methods using Projects within Github.  This is focused around KanBan boards for planning, monitoring progress and also provides an option for logging work.

All details relating to this repository are available in the wiki section.
